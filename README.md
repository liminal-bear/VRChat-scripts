# VRChat-scripts
.cs and .meta files for VRChat UdonSharp scripts.

"UdonSharp is a compiler that compiles C# to Udon assembly." It is a prerequisite in order to use these scripts.
UdonSharp allows hand-written code to be used, rather than graph-based code. It is highly necessary for making complex scripts in any reasonable capacity.

* basic object
* door
* player
* toy
* ui
